## Create a React Component

You're going to be seeing these React Class Components all the time, so now would be a great time to get comfortable with them. Remember in this exercise you don't have to define the component, you just need to make a function return a little html in between the marked lines.

```javascript
render(){
 return(<div><h1>Text that will pass the tests!</h1></div>);
   }
};
```
Note that you don't need to put quotes around the text, because when you are working with JSX it is treated as HTML. Also check to make sure your spelling, case, and punctuation are correct! If all this code looks strange, go check out some of the great material on Javascript ES6 here on freeCodeCamp.
