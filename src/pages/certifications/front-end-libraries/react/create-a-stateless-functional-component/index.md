Here's a bit more than a hint. Your code should end up looking like this:

```javascript
const YourComponent= function () {
    return (<div> "Some text" 
    </div>);
}
```
So there you have it, the basic building block of React. I recommend really reviewing your vanilla javascript and especially ES6; as React is going to be using those concepts.
